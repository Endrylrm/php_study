# PHP Study

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning PHP. Here, you'll find code snippets, exercises, and small projects that help me explore and understand the basics of PHP. My goal is to improve my skills in web development and gain a deeper understanding of server-side scripting.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or leave feedback as I continue to learn and grow with PHP!
